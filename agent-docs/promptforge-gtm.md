## 2. Competitive Landscape

| Tool Name         | Pricing Model                                   | What They Charge / Lack                                     | Our Edge                                                          |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PromptBase**    | Marketplace (commission on sales)               | Prompts are expensive; focus on selling, not pure generation. | Free, no-cost access to a vast array of prompts.                    |
| **FlowGPT**       | Freemium (limited free, subscription for access) | Requires login; community-curated but can be overwhelming. | No login required, instant access, simpler interface.             |
| **Vercel AI Playground** | Free (requires login, developer-focused)      | Technical audience; not for casual users; requires sign-up. | Broad appeal, user-friendly for non-developers, no login.         |
| **Prompt Perfect**| Subscription-based (paid)                       | Paid service, focuses on *optimizing* existing prompts.     | Free core functionality; focus on *discovery* and *creation*.     |
| **Hugging Face**  | Free (requires login for many features/spaces)  | Primarily a platform for models, not a dedicated prompt tool. | Dedicated, streamlined prompt generation experience.                |
| **PromptHero**    | Freemium (login needed for full access/features) | Primarily image prompts; text prompts can be secondary.     | Strong focus on high-quality text prompts, no login needed.       |
| **Forefront AI**  | Freemium (limited free tier, paid tiers)        | Requires login; offers many tools, may dilute focus.        | Simplicity, speed, and direct prompt generation without complexity. |

**Our Edge Summary:** PromptForge stands out by removing friction (no login, free) and prioritizing a delightful user experience, making advanced AI prompting accessible to everyone.
